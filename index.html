* HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language
* HTML is the raw data webpages are made out of 
* Defines the structure and content of webpages
* Opening tags <> and closing tags </> 
* Elements are containers, void elements don't have a closing tag because they don't have any content inside of them

CSS
* Styling (i.e. fonts)

VSCode Shortcuts
